I am going to try switching [Stylus][Stylus] style management from
JSON import/export to [UserCSS][UserCSS] (also managed by the Stylish
project) to see if that makes it easier to synchronize styles across
systems.

[Stylish]: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/
[UserCSS]: https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/wiki/Usercss

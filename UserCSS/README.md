This is a Stylus "user style" repository. If you have Stylus installed
in [Firefox][Firefox] or [Chrome][Chrome] these files will be
recognized as [UserCSS][UserCSS] format and visiting the "raw" style
code will prompt you to install them.

The styles below mostly perform masking of elements I'd rather not
see. I prefer compact web pages without "extraneous" bits or generous
margins and paddings, and user style plugins excel at such cleanup:

* Advertising, self-promotional blocks, social media widgets
* Video or interactive frames, since I rarely allow Javascript to run
* Occasionally whole sections I'm not interested in (eg "Technology"
  on many sites is just another advertising block)

### Individual Styles

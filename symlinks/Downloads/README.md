### Tiddlywiki support for FireFox

FireFox 57 is __MESSING EVERYTHING UP__. [TiddlyWikis][TW] now can
only be loaded from a subfolder in `~/Downloads` (_WHY WHY WHY_). The
`tiddlywikilocations` symlink points to the filer's shared location of
TiddlyWikis.

* FF57 needs to use the [savetiddlers][savetiddlers] XPI
  addon. Unfortunately this is not hosted on/reviewed by the Mozilla
  addons site.
* Older versions of FF should use the [tiddlyfox][tiddlyfox] addon.
